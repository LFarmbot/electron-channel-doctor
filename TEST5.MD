# Project Status: TEST5.MD

## Problem

The `node bin/cli.js health` command is still failing with an `Invalid regular expression` error. This is because the file scanning logic is including files from `node_modules`, which contain code that the application's parser cannot handle.

## What's Been Tried

1.  **Switched to `glob.sync`**: Replaced all asynchronous `glob` calls with their synchronous counterparts to simplify the file scanning process.
2.  **Fixed `ast-parser.js`**: Corrected the module exports in `lib/ast-parser.js` by replacing its contents with a more complete version from a backup file (`lib/ast-parser copy.js`) and then deleting the backup.
3.  **Improved Regex Generation**: Made the regular expression generation in `lib/unused-code-detector.js` more robust to handle a wider variety of import statements.
4.  **Corrected Ignore Logic**: Fixed an issue in the `ChannelDoctor` constructor where the default `ignore` patterns were being overwritten.
5.  **Attempted Manual Filtering**: Modified `lib/unused-code-detector.js` to manually filter out files from `node_modules`, `dist`, and `build` after getting the file list from `glob`.

## Current Status

The manual filtering fix has been applied to `lib/unused-code-detector.js`, but the same change still needs to be made to `lib/index.js` to ensure the `scanForInvokeCalls` method also ignores the correct directories. The `ignore` option in `glob` is still not functioning as expected, but this workaround should resolve the issue.

Once `lib/index.js` is updated, the `health` command should finally run without crashing.
