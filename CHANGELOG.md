## [2.2.1] - 2024-05-24

### Fixed
- Resolved a series of cascading errors in the `health` command that originated from an `Invalid regular expression` bug in the complexity analysis.
- Stabilized file scanning by converting all `glob` calls to `glob.sync` across `unused-code-detector.js`, `security-analyzer.js`, and `architecture-analyzer.js`, eliminating "path must be a string" errors.
- Corrected faulty regex construction in the `calculateComplexity` method.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-01-15
