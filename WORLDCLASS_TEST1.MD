### **Project:** `electron-channel-doctor` Improvement Initiative

**Core Objective:** Evolve the `electron-channel-doctor` into a world-class analysis tool. The immediate goal is to enhance its precision and usability by addressing user feedback on inaccurate results and lack of configuration. This involves refining its analysis scope and improving the core detection algorithms.

**Current State:**
*   **Phase:** All Phases Complete
*   **Last Action:** Completed Phase 2, Task 3. Enhanced the health report's verbose output to provide clear, actionable details on duplicate code, including code snippets and all locations. The two-phase improvement plan is now fully implemented.

**The Master Plan:**

**Phase 1: Precision Targeting - Enhance Configuration and File Filtering (✅ COMPLETE)**
*   **Goal:** Significantly reduce noise and improve report accuracy by analyzing only relevant project files.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Implement Smart Defaults:** Natively ignore common non-project directories (`node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, etc.) to provide clean results out-of-the-box.
    2.  **Empower the User:** Introduce a command-line flag (e.g., `--ignore`) that allows users to provide custom glob patterns for excluding specific files or directories.
    3.  **Optimize Discovery:** Refine the file discovery mechanism to be faster and more efficient while honoring all ignore configurations.

**Phase 2: Intelligent Analysis - Refine Duplicate Code Detection (✅ COMPLETE)**
*   **Goal:** Increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the duplicate code analysis, making its findings more reliable and actionable.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Algorithm Audit:** Deep-dive into the current duplicate code detection algorithm to identify its operational parameters and limitations.
    2.  **Sensitivity Tuning:** Refine the algorithm to reduce false positives. This could involve adjusting token thresholds, implementing smarter parsing to ignore boilerplate, or using more advanced comparison techniques.
    3.  **Actionable Reporting:** Enhance the output to provide more context for duplicates, such as side-by-side code snippets and clearer location data, enabling developers to make faster, more informed decisions.
